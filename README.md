## Introduction

This is a Vehicle Routing Problem solver compatible with a range of VRP variants. We introduced a new form of Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and it was finetuned to fit CVRP in this repo, and performs well on [Capacitated VRP Instances](http://neo.lcc.uma.es/vrp/vrp-instances/capacitated-vrp-instances/). Below are some tricks we employed in the algorithm.

* We introduced an innovative genetic coding method, which is compatible with a range of VRP variants.
* We employed Variable Neighborhood Search after every generation of Genetic Algorithm to accelerate the convergence rate.
* There are 4 populations which evolve concurrently, and they swap a proportion of good genes every few generations.

## Hybrid Genetic Algorithm

### Genetic Coding

![coding](./img/coding.JPG)

The chromosome is a loop consisting of both vehicle and customer genes, shown above, where $V_i$ represents a vehicle of type $i$ and $C_j$ a customer with ID $j$.  

Thus, the route in this chromosome decodes as:

```
Route1(with Vehicle Type-1): depot -> customer1 -> customer2 -> customer3 -> depot
Route2(with Vehicle Type-1): depot -> customer4 -> customer5 -> depot
Route3(with Vehicle Type-2): depot -> customer6 -> customer7 -> depot
```

### Loss Metrics

We defined the loss function as:

$loss=distancePrior \cdot total\_distance+timePrior \cdot total\_time+loadPrior \cdot average\_load\_factor$

and our goal is to minimize the loss function.

As the scale of distance, time and load factor is different, some tricks are applied to normalize them.

### Initialization

![population](./img/population.JPG)

All four populations are initialized randomly, except for a Clark-Wright Saving constructed super individual pushed into population 0. Each population takes up a geographical position, as illustrated above, according to which migration will take place.

### Crossover

![crossover](./img/crossover.JPG)

Offsprings are reproduced with the crossover operator. Specification is commented below.

1. Randomly choose 2 individuals, written P1(left-hand side) and P2(right-hand side).
2. For P1, a gene fragment is sliced randomly, written S1. And we obtain S2 by removing all the customers appearing in S1 from P2. 
3. Concatenate the two fragments S1 and S2. 
4. Remove useless vehicles which have no customer to serve.

### Mutation

We designed two kinds of mutation operators, which are customer-base and vehicle-based. Illustrations are better than explanation.

#### Customer-Based Mutation

* Swap

* Shift

  <img src="./img/shift.JPG" alt="shift" style="zoom:80%;" />

* Reverse

  <img src="./img/reverse.JPG" alt="reverse" style="zoom:80%;" />



#### Vehicle-Based Mutation

* Change

  <img src="./img/change.JPG" alt="change" style="zoom:80%;" />

* Insert

  <img src="./img/insert.JPG" alt="insert" style="zoom:80%;" />

* Remove

<img src="./img/remove.JPG" alt="remove" style="zoom:80%;" />

### Selection

We select the top **ELITE_RATE**% individuals with lowest $loss$ directly to the next generation. And for the remains, simulated-annealing like method is applied, which is to keep the good individual and to accept relatively bad individual with a proper probability.

### Finetune

We randomly perform **swap**, **shift**, **reverse** and **remove** many times to search the neighbor of a chromosome with the probability of **FINETUNE_RATE** for it is a heavily time-consuming operation. It drastically enhanced the performance of the algorithm.

### Migration

![avatar](./img/migrate.JPG)

Migration is applied every **MIGRATION_STEP** generations. The migration between Populaiton 0 and 1, 2 and 3 is bidirectional, whereas between Population 0 and 2, 1 and 3 is one-way. Such direction constraint ensures that the super individual constructed by CWS in Population 0 will not contaminate the whole species.

### Benchmark

We tested our algorithm on  [Capacitated VRP Instances](http://neo.lcc.uma.es/vrp/vrp-instances/capacitated-vrp-instances/). We set **distancePrior**=1, **timePrior**=0, **loadPrior**=0 in order to minimize the distance. Below are the result with 200 generations.
